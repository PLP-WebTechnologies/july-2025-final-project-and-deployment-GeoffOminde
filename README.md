## 🎨 Customization
1. **Content**:  
   Replace placeholder text (`Lorem ipsum...`) with your real content.  

2. **Images**:  
   Put your images in the `/images/` folder and update `<img src="images/...">` paths.

4. **Colors & Fonts**:  
   Modify `css/style.css` to match your brand identity.  



## ⚙️ Running the Website
Since this is a **static website**, you don’t need a server:  
- Simply open `index.html` in your browser.  
- Or run a local server for testing:
  ```bash
  # Using Python 3
  python -m http.server 8000
Then visit http://localhost:8000
.

📌 Future Enhancements

Add backend (Node.js, PHP, Laravel, etc.) for contact form submissions.

Convert blog to a dynamic CMS (WordPress, Ghost, or custom).

Add animations (using libraries like GSAP or AOS).

Deploy to hosting platforms like Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Vercel.

Would you like me to also create a **basic `images/` set with placeholders + favicon** so your website loads without any missing assets when you copy-paste?
